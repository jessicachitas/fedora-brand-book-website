The Fedora Project is a community of people working together to build a free and open source software platform and to collaborate on and share user-focused solutions built on that platform. Or, in plain English, we make an operating system and we make it easy for you to do useful stuff with it.

The Fedora community includes thousands of individuals with different views and approaches, but together we share some common values. We call these the “Four Foundations”: Freedom, Friends, Features, and First.

|=======================
|image:images/foundations_Freedom.png[alt="Freedom",width=350,height=350] | *We are dedicated to free software and content.*

Advancing software and content freedom is a central community goal, which we accomplish through the software and content we promote. We choose free alternatives to proprietary code and content and limit the effects of proprietary or patent encumbered code on the Project.
|image:images/foundations_Friends.png[alt="Friends",width=350,height=350]    | *We are a strong, caring community.*

The Fedora community is made up of people from all walks of life, working together to advance free software. There is a place in Fedora for anyone who wants to help, regardless of technical skill level, as long as they believe in our core values.
|image:images/foundations_Features.png[alt="Features",width=350,height=350]    | *We care about excellent software.*

The Fedora community creates many of the technical features that have made Linux powerful, flexible, and usable for a wide spectrum of millions of users, administrators, and developers worldwide. We recognize the status quo is worth changing to empower additional end-users, or to create a more flexible and powerful environment for building new solutions on the free software we provide.
|image:images/foundations_First.png[alt="First",width=350,height=350]   | *We are committed to innovation.*

We are not content to let others do all the heavy lifting on our behalf; we provide the latest in stable and robust, useful, and powerful free software in our Fedora distribution.

These logos are used for many purposes across many different designs, including software applications, web sites, T-shirts, event booth tablecloths and banners, and other printed material. 

While it may seem as if your change to the logo is minor, the impact of such changes is much more widespread than you might initially think. We seek to have a consistent and recognizable logo that is taken seriously in order to help us fulfil Fedora's mission of leading the advancement of free and open source software and content.

Don't search for the logos on a search engine and use whatever you find there. There are many unofficial variations on the Fedora logos that are not authorized, are unofficial, and do not respect these guidelines. Please do not use them or spread them further!

Here are some guidelines you should avoid if you would like to use some of our logos:

|=======================

We keep a single color palette to keep our artwork consistent, whether it is different Fedora materials, Fedora materials on screen, on the web, or on printed materials. Past mistakes have included Fedora DVDs coming out purple (true story!) so please pay attention to these colors, and please always use CMYK colors for professionally-printed collateral and objects such as printed banners, T-shirts, hats, and stickers. Otherwise, your design may well come out purple instead of blue!

We recommend the following complementary fonts to use along with the logos. Both recommended fonts are openly licensed and freely distributable.

We recommend using Open Sans as a body text / copy font. It comes in a wide range of weights.

We recommend using Montserrat as a titling / headline font. Montserrat is also used in the Fedora Editions logos.

Most of these characters were created as part of the Fedora Characters Revamp Project. These mascots can be used in different projects.

You will be introduced to Badger, Beefy, Panda and Colúr and their history within the Fedora Community along with what part they belong to as well.

Panda
~~~~~

Panda is a happy go-lucky panda with glowing ears and a glowing nuclear symbol on her stomach and was originally created as a helper. You were able to find her on on the 404 and 500 pages and also was in the Fedora Docs pointing out tips and tricks. Panda is female and is a general mascot for the Fedora community. In 2021, intern Lauryn Dake redesigned the Panda during the Fedora Character Revamp Project.

|=======================

Badger
~~~~~~

Badger is the Fedora Badges mascot and has been featured on a lot of different badges throughout the years. Badger was fist inspired by a popular early 2000's internet meme involving badgers and snakes. Badger is non-binary. In 2021, intern Lauryn Dake brought them to life by creating a new style for  the Badger to fit in to the Fedora style.

|=======================

Beefy
~~~~~

Beefy is a general mascot for the Fedora Community. He was the release name for Fedora 17 and has been a popular character even before Fedora Linux! He became a meme between Linux users. Beefy is male and on his belly, the mustard indicates progress. He was also a bootup screen for Fedora in past years and as it was loading, the mustard on his belly grew. In 2021, intern Lauryn Dake revamped the style of Beefy and created him in many poses.  If you would like to know more about the origins of the Beefy Miracle, please visit:

Colúr
~~~~~

Colúr is our newest character that was created as a mascot for our Flock events. In 2022, Jess Chitas created him to go along with the Flock events and to also bring a new Fedora character to the table! He is based on the Pink-Necked Green Pigeon and his name came from the Irish meaning Pigeon but also sounds like the word 'Color'.

There is a lot to the Fedora brand and there may be things we haven't been able to cover in this guide.

However, if you need help working with the logo to make sure you are following the guidelines or want to do something different with it, please email logo@fedoraproject.org and we would be delighted to help you!
