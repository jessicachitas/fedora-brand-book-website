The Fedora Project is a community of people working together to build a free and open source software platform and to collaborate on and share user-focused solutions built on that platform. Or, in plain English, we make an operating system and we make it easy for you to do useful stuff with it.

The Fedora community includes thousands of individuals with different views and approaches, but together we share some common values. We call these the “Four Foundations”: Freedom, Friends, Features, and First.

|=======================
|image:images/foundations_Freedom.png[alt="Freedom",width=350,height=350] | *We are dedicated to free software and content.*

Advancing software and content freedom is a central community goal, which we accomplish through the software and content we promote. We choose free alternatives to proprietary code and content and limit the effects of proprietary or patent encumbered code on the Project.
|image:images/foundations_Friends.png[alt="Friends",width=350,height=350]    | *We are a strong, caring community.*

The Fedora community is made up of people from all walks of life, working together to advance free software. There is a place in Fedora for anyone who wants to help, regardless of technical skill level, as long as they believe in our core values.
|image:images/foundations_Features.png[alt="Features",width=350,height=350]    | *We care about excellent software.*

The Fedora community creates many of the technical features that have made Linux powerful, flexible, and usable for a wide spectrum of millions of users, administrators, and developers worldwide. We recognize the status quo is worth changing to empower additional end-users, or to create a more flexible and powerful environment for building new solutions on the free software we provide.
|image:images/foundations_First.png[alt="First",width=350,height=350]   | *We are committed to innovation.*

We are not content to let others do all the heavy lifting on our behalf; we provide the latest in stable and robust, useful, and powerful free software in our Fedora distribution.

These logos are used for many purposes across many different designs, including software applications, web sites, T-shirts, event booth tablecloths and banners, and other printed material. 

While it may seem as if your change to the logo is minor, the impact of such changes is much more widespread than you might initially think. We seek to have a consistent and recognizable logo that is taken seriously in order to help us fulfil Fedora's mission of leading the advancement of free and open source software and content.
